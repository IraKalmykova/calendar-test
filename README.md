## Workflow
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
## Development mode 

- Run `npm start` to start development server on `http://localhost:3000`
    When you run server the command line window will no longer be available for 
    writing commands until you stop server (`ctrl + c`). All other commands you 
    need to run in new command line window.
- run `npm run lint` to check code style
    
## Project structure

- `src/` - directory for css, js, image, fonts files
- `build/` - directory for built pages
